        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <div id="main_photo"></div>
        <p>My experiences with stereotype threat stem from my time at Duke as a student athlete. During my time at school, and to some extent post-graduation, other members of the Duke community often felt that they could rightfully lump all athletes into the catagory of lazy and unintelligent people. Often times I found myself having to defend my acceptance into the university or letting other students know that I did actually have to do my own work.</p>
        <p> I don't think that my time spent academically at Duke should have an asterisks next to it due to my participation in athletics. However, to some that tends to be the case. This attitude from some of the faculty and student body certainly had an effect on me and I know it shaped how some other members of my team saw themselves at the school.</p>
        <p> Certainly my experiences with being stereotyped were not nearly at malicious as other ethnic groups or members of the lgbt community have had to deal with. However, my experiences have led me to a greater understanding of how stereotyping can be hurtful and harm others well being. If you feel stereotyped you should speak up to let people know their notions of who you are are not correct and that individual should ammend their thought process. Of course this will not work for everyone, there are unfortunately certain closed minded individuals out there who will never change their opinions. But if an informative conversation can change someone's opinion it is a great option for someone feeling threatened by stereotyping.</p>
