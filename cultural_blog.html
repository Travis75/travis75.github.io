		        <p>I think when I first began looking into Bootcamps in general I definitely had the "let me order what I want" mentality. I saw these camps and read up on them and thought "Hey in 12 weeks I can have a job as a developer, sign me up!" However, as I began my preparation to interview I realized how difficult coding can be, as well as how rewarding it is when you finally get that bug out of your code. But I started to question whether this was the right course of action. I realized how much work I would have to put in, this wasn't just going to be like waving a magic wand. The realization I came to was that I wanted this. I wanted to do whatever I could to turn myself into a developer. Everything I have gone through so far has both excited me and scared me. But it hasn't scared me enough to get me to run away. I'm definitely going to go into DBC with some question marks about where this is going to take me or if I will be able to get through it. However, writing code is something I've found very rewarding so far and I never look at it as a burden. With that said I do want to get into DBC and do exactly what Shereef said, take charge of my experience!
