		        <p> Abstract Random thinkers seem to be exactly what the name sounds like. You are emotional and work on feelings and work well with others...etc etc. Like all of the types of tests that tell you your learning style or personality or anything, I think this gives some good insights and reaches on a lot of others.</p>
		        <p> I find that these tests help you with looking introspectively about yourself and how you function best as a learner. I would tend to say what stuck out to me most was the fact that Abstract Random thinkers need personalization. I really work best when I have someone to work with so I can break a problem down. Reading something online never gets the point across. I work best when I've got someone to bounce ideas off of and to explain something I might not understand completely. That is something I need to work on because I have so far shied away  from working with others on something I know I'm not great at yet. I just feel like I know so little that I would be more of a burdern than a help. That is obviously something I need to get over and work on.</p>
		        <p> With a growth mindset about learning do I think my style might change over time? I already think I've got different learning styles, probably like everyone. Yes predominantly I may currently learn best in an Abstract Random enviroment. However, I think that changes as I learn more on a topic. For example. I know that when I started playing football, I had to learn from coaches. I couldn't watch film (not that a 13 year old would) and gain any insights. I would have been confused and bored. But as I got older and grew into the sport my styles defintely changed. I put in a lot of hours in the film room later in life and I think once I could pick up on positives and negatives in my own performance from the years of practice a structured film session on my own did me a lot of good. </p>
