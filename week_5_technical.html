		  <h1> Pair Programming</h1>
		  <div id = "var"> </div>
		  <p> Pair programming has been something I've yet to get totally comfortable with. I think that the issue I've had is I want to take time and think through a problem rather than immediately talk it out. Getting over that has been hard but I've just started telling people when we start on a problem let's both take a few minutes to grasp this on our own and then come back to it. This has worked well because I can speak to the problem much more effectively if I know what the problem is all about.

			<p> Getting over some of the nerves and working with other people has been really great and a helpful learning tool. Not only do I feel that I am able to get a different perspective on a problem but I can also bounce ideas off of my partner and get some feedback. What I've enjoyed most about pair programming is the rapid transfer of knowledge. Sometimes when I am working alone I sit on a specific block or bit of code for an hour or so before I can figure out what is wrong. But with a different set of eyes on something that takes mintues and you can learn much more quickly.

			<p> Of course once the pairing is over you have to wait for feedback! I've yet to receive feedback I thought was truly negative or it hurt to read. I rarely feel nervous or anxious about feedback. I think a lot of that comes from my athletic background and constantly being coached from other players and coaches on staff. That is something that I feel really helps me in the real world because I feel that I am good at taking criticism and using it to make myself better. Based on my feedback I think I should be more active and less quiet when I am unsure of a problem. Even if I am wrong or not entirely sure of what something is doing I can voice my opinion. That is something I am working on as I tend to only want to speak when I am sure of something, which can take a while when you are new to coding.
			</p>
			<p> I think the hardest part of writing feedback was finding things for people to improve upon. I have yet to work with someone where I feel like they are not doing a great job or really helping me learn.
