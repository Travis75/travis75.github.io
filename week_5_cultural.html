		  <h1> When to Use Instance Variables - And Classes Too</h1>
		  <div id = "var"> </div>
		  <p> Well this week I got a great lesson in what instance variables can and cannot do. So I thought I should share the insights with the group. But first I'll get to Classes.
			</p>
			<p> Classes are great if you are trying to keep your code organized and readable as well as avoid any unintended effects of certain blocks / methods if you have a larger program. Secondly, Classes can keep things private which means that messing with variables and methods outside of a class can be kept to a minimum.
			</p>
			<p> Instance Variables have to be initialized upon creating a class. I think of the instance variable as the value to my key in a class. For example if I have a variable I must set it equal to the class and the arguments that the class takes. Those arguments are the instance variables...they always remain with the instance (or in my own words 'key') that created them. So if you have a class called Shoes and you created a new instance of shoes called new_jordans and set that equal to whatever specific type of jordan's you bought.
