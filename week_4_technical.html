		  <h1> .Count & The Enumerable Module </h1>
		  <div id = "enum"> </div>
		  <p> If we are going to talk about .count we have to bring
		  	up Enumerables first. The Enumerable module consists of a
		  	bunch of really helpful methods that iterate through arrays
				doing all sorts of cool and mysterious stuff, .cycle is one
				of those really great methods.</p>
			<p> Not every Class can use Enumerables however. And it is
				important to note that if you are creating a class in order
				to use the Enumerable module you <em> must </em> provide
				the class explicit directions giving it the ability to use
				the .each method. This can be done with the yield keyword.
			</p>
			<p> Once you've got all that sorted out,  or if you are using
				a class predefined by Ruby that Enumerables already work with
				such as Class and Array you can utilize all the great Enumerable
				methods. .Cycle is one of those methods. .Cycle takes an argument
				and will iterate through it an infinite number of times unless
				unless .cycle is given an argument to define the number of loops
				you would like to make.
			</p>
			<p> The proper syntax for .cycle is as follows: <br>
				ary = [1,2,3,4]
				ary.cycle {|x| puts x} => 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4...
				ary.cycle(2) {|x| puts x} 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4
			</p>
