		        <p>We are going to learn about positioning...and you are going to like it! First off, there are technically four types of positioning. You can have Static, Relative, Fixed, and Absolute. In order to utlize positioning you have to understand that each element on a web page is a block. Think of a big white sheet of paper and on top of that paper sits a bunch of other smaller pieces of paper. That is your web page. <br> <strong> Static</strong> positioning is the default position of any element on a page. If you set your element to static then the element will sit on your page exactly how it would have without the tag. <br><strong>Relative</strong> positioning is moving the element relative to <em>itself</em>. So the element only moves if you kick it into shape and give it some orders (top,left, bottom, right). If you set your element to relative and wash your hands of it after that it will not move. Why you ask? Well because it only moves in relation to where it was going to be in the first place. You have to tell it where to move if you want to see any results. <br><strong>Fixed</strong> positioning is relative to the browser window. So with fixed positioning you can keep the header on the page at all times, even if you scroll down beyond where it would normally sit. An element that has a fixed position is literally anchored into place and won't budge for anyone!<br><strong>Absolute</strong> positioning moves an element in relation to that element's parent. So for example if you have two div tags that are nested, the parent being an image and the child being some text you want positioned, the child will be positioned based off of the parent tag. Absolute positioning will only position an element based off the the parent which can be very useful if you want a div to sit nice and pretty on top of another element!

		        <p id = "second"> Something else that is pretty awesome about positioning is that it gives you the ability to use the <strong>z-index</strong>. What the z-index does is literally stack elements on top of one another. It is basically like being given a ticket number and waiting until your number is called. In the z-index a higher number means it is further in front than an element with a lower z-index. This can be really useful if you want to stack several elements on top of one another.
