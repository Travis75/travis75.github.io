        <h1>Dealing With Conflict</h1>
        <div id="main_photo"></div>
        <p>Since being in a relationship with my girlfriend, I have found it to sometimes be challenging emotionally. There are some times when we do not see eye-to-eye, which I found to be frustrating. This was because our conflict usually arose between very insignificant things, habits each other has, rather than real issues. I believe that I have learned a lot from these disagreementsâ€”both about my girlfriend and myself. A lot of times we feel this way towards each other because we can be tired or hungry, basic reasons for feeling cranky. The best thing I can do in these situations is reflect what I might need to do to change the situation, and from there I can make the right decision I see fit. If I did not personally reflect on improving any of the situations, and acted more from my emotions which were sometimes rash, then that usually made things worse.</p>
