        <h1>What is SQL Injection?</h1>
        <div id="main_photo"></div>
        <p>SQL injection is the process by which hackers can attempt to gain private information from a site by using crafted SQL commands through legitimate user input forms. The malicious attempts are often sucessful because those responsible for site mantience and design did not properly sanitize the code. Code sanitization is the process by which you can identify and eliminate malicious code that is trying to expand the scope of the legitimate query each user input field initiates.</p>
        <p> For a new programmer like myself the concept is simple to grasp but to sanitize my own code seems like a tall order right now(but hopefully not for long). But not to worry, there are a number of resources out there (stackoverflow, just plain old Google) that can help you with code snippets that will sanatize code. </p>
