        <h1>What is Rails?</h1>
        <div id="main_photo"></div>
        <p> Rails, is a a library of software. In the most basic sense, Rails is just like any other extension to Ruby that you can bake into your code. Rails came into being in 2004 when David Hansson created Rails by extracting it from Basecamp (a project management tool that David helped found).
          </p>
        <p> Rails is a web application framework that makes it easy to design and work with web applications. It makes communication with databases easier, and just everything else easier in general. It does this by creating a framework you can have your code work within.
        </p>
        <p> The framework Rails works within is called the MVC model (Model, View, Controller). The model part of the code handles all database calls. The controller aspect handles the web server. And the view handles all of what you view...namely the HTML and CSS aspect of the code. More concretely the view will take the user interaction and hand it off to the model so that it in turn can utilize the proper controller and produce the desired results.
        </p>
        <p> The framework of Rails makes web applications quick and easy to build which is why so many people utilize the framework. It is built with Ruby as the backbone so a strong working knowledge of Ruby is extremely helpful in the construction and design of your Ruby on Rails site. </p>
