		        <p> People talk about Javascript being great/awesome/fantastic all the time. Or at least that was my perception before looking into it. And I had no idea why that was the case, other that the requisite 'It's so easy to learn'. What I found was pretty interesting. There was a lot of arguments on both sides of the equation saying Javascript is great and some also saying that it isn't worth it.</p>
		        <p> Well let's talk about why Javascript is so integral to web applications! Javascript is great for making interactive web applications. Why is that the case? Well in my reading I've come to a few conclusions. Firstly, Javascript does not need a complier to run. Which means that the computer doesn't need to turn the code into even more basic code in order to run the program. The computer can just read each line and excute as it goes. Which makes Javascript simple to implement. But that in and of itself isn't all that special. Why is it <em>the</em>language of the web? Well probably partly the first part but the main reason is, Javascript is the only scripting language supported by all broswers. In theory if your browser supported another scripting language then you could use it. However, for a fully functional professional website you need to take into account that people will be using all sorts of web browsers. And if you want their experience to be interactive at all a scripting language is going to have to come into play. And for scripting languages that work across all browsers all roads lead to Javascript. So you better learn it if you want to make a sweet website!</p>
		        <p> Why is Javascript bad? The answers I've found mostly stem from the fact that Javascript itself is actually missing a lot of key elements that great lanaguages have. One that keeps popping up...Javascript doesn't have classes, which is apparently just awful. Well to fix this Javascript propoents created JQuery / CoffeScript / Etc (those are not similar products, but I grouped them together to show that there was a lot of stuff created for JS). These products were designed to patch some of the holes in Javascript, and they do. But the argument against them is the fact that you are essentially just putting band-aids on a severely broken product. Which means that eventually all these stop gap measuers will stop working or people will get fed up and stop using Javascript.
