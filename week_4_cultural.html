		  <p> What I've heard a lot about lately has been the lack of diversity in the tech community. I think it has been coming up more and more in the past few years as people like Sheryl Sandberg gain publicity and make these issues known.

			<p> I hope that over time the roadblocks that hinder diversity in the tech world can be moved. I know that the hot button issue right now with diversity in tech is the lack of women, but the lack of African-Americans and other minority groups within the tech community is just as appaerent. I think the best way to countermand the situation is foster excitement about technology from a young age specifically targeting under-represented groups. If you can open the eyes of young women and minority groups to the coolness of tech early on I think more and more people will care to learn about it. And learning a technical skill is not only extremely valuable but empowering as well. If children can feel technologically empowered from a young age hopefully fewer kids will opt out of technology and more will opt in. I know that fostering excitement in kids is only one small step in the right direction but it would hopefully be an impactful start.
