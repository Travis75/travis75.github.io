        <h1>How to Ask the Right Questions</h1>
        <div id="main_photo"></div>
        <p>Having had a career in sales up until this point I understand the importance of asking great questions. Questions are integral in any conversation and for you to learn the answers and why they are important you need to first listen and understand well.</p>
        <p> Of course sales and programming are very different animals. Now I am not trying to understand a potential buyers willingness to purcahse but I am trying to understand why a certain function won't work...or if it does work, why? However, the principles still apply. In the case of programming it means understanding what went wrong or what you are asking. Asking broad questions or questions that muddle what you are looking for will not help you and make it difficult for people who actually know the answer to help. Therefore it is imperative you have done the understanding portion. Understanding means knowing why you asked the question. </p>
        <p> The other integral part of getting the most out of questions is listening to the answer. That means really trying to grasp what the answer means for you and your code. If you ask someone to help you fix the html tags on your page, you need to listen to why there was an issue in the first place. Having the answer doesn't mean you have the understanding it takes to realize why the answer is correct. It is important to listen. </p>
