		        <p>I love reading Yahoo because of the news articles it cycles through daily. When I first log on I am immediately drawn towards the large pictures displayed at the center. These photos cycle and each represents a different story being highlighted. I would consider it the most important aspect of Yahoo. The content is informative and broad. You can get a great sense of the goings on in the world with the main page. Yaho takes a very practical and no frills approach to their site. Unfortunately, this leads to Yahoo being extremely cluttered. The websites is too busy to actually find something you are looking for. After spending a few minutes on the main photos and news I generally leave because the rest of the site is rather intimidating to search through. Due to that I can't say for certainty that Yahoo doesn't sell anything, but

		    <h1>Netflix.com</h1>
		        <div id = "Netflix"> </div> 
		        <p> I enjoy Neflix because, well I love watching TV and movies. And I especially like watching them when I should be doing other work. So right now for example, I feel a strong pull towards typing in n-e-t-f-l-i-x into my browser and calling Phase 0 a day! Back to work though...I am immediately drawn towards the top of the page where there is a "What's New" section. This is clean and crisp and feels well designed. There are only a few new items which helps to narrow down my choice if there is something up there I like. However if I don't see something up there I am often searching through the extensive video library for an extended period of time. It can take a while to find something I enjoy and that is one of the pitfalls of Netfilx. More choices means less choice on my part! Netflix does sell their service but if you are on the site and watching videos you have already bought it.</p>
		    <h1>Techcrunch.com</h1>
		        <div id = "Techcrunch"> </div> 
		        <p> Techcruch is probably the most sparse of the three sites. The landing page is an agregator of all the blogs that are put up on the site each day under vaious tags (ie Enterprise/Startup). Initially I am drawn to the featured story on the top, it is given a large photo and caption. However, I rarely click on this and instead tend to scroll down to read the day's stories. I think this design is fanastic because you do not miss much content with the minimalist layout. (Not sure if it is really minimalist...but I'm going with it.) It is definitely simple to navigate through. I don't think Techcrunch sells anything.</p>
