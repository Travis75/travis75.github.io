        <p>I have been working to redevelop my site for several weeks now. It has taken me quite some time and I am pretty happy with the outcome so far. With that said it is still a work in progress.</p>
        <p> Everytime I get to work on my site I feel excited/nervous/hopeful of the things to come. I feel like my site is an embodiment of not only my progress towards learing to become a developer but also a marker of what I am looking to do in the future. Writing code has been an entirely new challenge for me so far. And there have been lows and highs. I have sat and looked at pretty bare HTML pages and wondered why something so simple was taking me hours to complete. I have written and re-written ruby code to complete excercises and it still doesn't work! It is enough to make you want to throw your computer across the room (I've thought about it). But at the end of the day when you have a newly redesigned site or have a challenge finished the sense of acomplishement is great and makes you come back for more. That is what I love about programming.</p>
