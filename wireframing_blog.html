		        <p> Yahoo tries to get you your daily does of everything right from their homepage. They don't want you to have to go anywhere else, regardless of what kind of news or information you are looking for. Because of that desire to give you absolutely everything under the Sun, the page is very cluttered. The design tries to make the user aware of everything available to them on Yahoo. However, because there is so much happening on the page there no easy way to find that information unless you are an avid Yahoo user.

		    <h1>Netflix.com</h1>
		        <div id = "Netflix"> <a href="http://imgur.com/sBXBxA7"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sBXBxA7s.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a></div> 
		        <p> Netflix wants you the user happily watching and discovering content all the time. The layout of their page suggests to me that they are more concerned with discovery of new content. The entire site is set up in order to help make it easier for the user to find something they might like. The largest part of the page is dedicated to the newest editions to Netflix. There are also easy to read and scroll through sections of Action, Comedy, etc, films and TV shows. </p>
		    <h1>Techcrunch.com</h1>
		        <div id = "Techcrunch"> <a href="http://imgur.com/K0HI95P"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/K0HI95Ps.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a></div> 
		        <p> Techcrunch wants to get you the best tech related news and events information and stories as they happen. To that end the entire site is built so that you find content based on the time it was posted vs looking at something that may be several days old. The uppermost part of the page has a few featured stories. However, the rest of the site is built vertically with newer stories posted on top. You can see when they were posted on the left hand side of the timeline. </p>
